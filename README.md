# Design-with-LESS


I had a simple web page with random content using LESS. The website uses the basic concepts as well as some advanced concepts of LESS.

These include variables, nested rules, mixings and operators etc.

I have also written parameterized mixins with default value, guarded mixins, built-in functions and @import directive.

                               How to view the HTML page in the browser
                               
  we need to first compile the .less to generate a css file which is referenced in the index.html file. To ompile it, we can use a server or can compile it on the client side.
  
  I used a client side less compiler which can be downloaded at https://wearekiss.com/simpless
  
  Once downloaded, extract it run the application. 
  
  Upon opening the application, drag and drop the "less" folder into the application. Then click on the refresh button next to the row with style.less. This creates a new file called style.css. 
  
  Once this file is created, open the index.html using any of the browsers to see the web page.
 
  More functionality/designed will be added soon
